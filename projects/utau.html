                <h2>Project Brief</h2>
                    <p>For my final major project for college, I decided to team up with another person to make a group project. Our idea was to create a vocal synthesiser, similar to Vocaloid, as well as promotional material (e.g. music video, designs) for these.
                        In this project, we both created a voicebank each. My role in this project was creating the characters used to represent those voicebanks, as well as producing a music video to go along side it.
                        My group partner then created 3D models based on these designs, and produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auq9PmcWh40" target="_blank">3D video of them dancing.</a>
                    </p>

            <h2>Pre-production</h2>
            <p>
                This project required a lot of pre-production. I first brain stormed ideas for the character designs, as seen below.
                I took the elements I like most out of each of the characters, and combined them to get a finshed product.
                After finally having character designs, I went on to produce designs for specifically for the video, since the plot of the video means they would have different designs.
                I created a storyboard and then using that made an animatic to get a rough idea of how the finished video would look.
                More information on the pre-production for this project can be found through my <a href="#adobe2">Adobe Express page.</a>

                    These are the final character designs I produced for the voicebanks.
                    The image on the left shows the characters normal outfits, which will be found in most of the promotional material.
                    The image on the right shows alternative outfits for the characters, which are found in the music video due to the backstory which the video follows.
